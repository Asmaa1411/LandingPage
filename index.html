        <p>
          We approach every aspect of our business with sustainability in
          mind. That's why we believe it's always worth trying to fix a
          system before outright replacing it, wherever possible – it
          requires fewer materials and is easier on the planet, as well as
          your wallet! If another company tells you that your system needs to
          be replaced, just give us a call and we'll see if we can repair
          it first.

                and Cornwall. If we were to sum ourselves up in a few words,
                those would be "reliable, honest and friendly." We find our
                customers agree! We're with you from the start of the project
                to the finish.

                As I'm sure you'll have seen, solar systems don't tend to come
                cheap. Our aim is to make solar power accessible to everyone,
                so we price ourselves in a way that makes solar energy more
                affordable. We're focused on helping you and on helping the
                environment, rather than on turning a profit.

                As we've said, we do this because we truly care about the
                planet and about seeing people embrace a greener, more
                eco-friendly approach to power. The world of green energy can
                be jargon-filled and opaque, so we want to help educate people
                on the big and little things they can do to protect our
                planet!
